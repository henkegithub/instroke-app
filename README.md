## Capstone Project of the Web Developer bootcamp at neuefische

Instroke App is a app designed for the purpose of helping out the staff at a restaurant which has also a bar, billard, darts and bowling to offer. it is located in kissing, bavaria, germany. The waitresses can get orders from customers safe and easy by letting the customers scan a barcode provided on each table in order to get food and drinks ordered for now.

In the future there will be also reserving billard, darts and bowling for sure.

The opening page or landing page is designed with a header named Instroke and a picture of the bar/restaurant/kitchen followed by a bottom you can click on in order to get to the next page.

It directs you to the "Order Menu" Page where you can see the Menu offered from Instroke and there you can select the amount of food and drinks you need, see the price and amount selected and even reset all your entrys.

On the bottom of the "Order Menu" page you can view the order or go back to the opening-page via buttons.

Once you click on the View Order Button a slider will pop up where you have a nice little overview over your Order and can see the amount selected and the total price. After selecting your table you can checkout and your order will be brought to you to your table!
